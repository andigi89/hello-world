# hello-world
it's a test

Hi Humans!

I'm Andi, 30 from Germany. Testing right now github and its functions. Personaly, I prefer Linux/BSD OS on my daily use. But I've a dual boot with Win 10. Anyhow all are OS with their own advantages. Moreover my favourite coding language is Python. Although I've got some skills in Java, C, C++ as well.
